Diabetes Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to build a classification model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health data. The model uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and includes data preprocessing steps to handle missing values and visualize the data and model performance.

Dataset
The dataset contains health-related features such as Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, and others, along with an outcome variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0).

Project Components
Data Upload & Preprocessing

Upload dataset (CSV format).

Replace zero values in certain columns with NaN for better handling of missing data.

Impute missing values using the median strategy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize missing values.

Plot feature distributions.

Correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between features.

Outcome class distribution plot.

Model Building

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

Predict diabetes outcome on test data.

Evaluation & Visualization

Calculate model accuracy.

Generate classification report (precision, recall, f1-score).

Visualize the confusion matrix.

How to Use
Upload your diabetes dataset CSV file when prompted (e.g., diabetes.csv).

Run the notebook/script.

Observe data visualizations and model performance metrics.

# KNN model training example
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately [insert your accuracy]% on the test set.

Confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the modelâ€™s performance.
